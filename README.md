<h2>Console Math Routines and a Console Menu System</h2>

<p>This repo contains my first real project in C# and .NET programming.</p>

<p>It consists of a Console Menu system that uses two classes Menu and MenuAction in order to fairly easily design and build one level menus</p>

<p>It also has the basics of a Math utility that uses classes for geometric or mathematic types and contain methods for various formulas such as area.</p>

<p>It will compile under .NET Core 3.1.  I used Visual Studio Code as my editor.  It also limits itself to simple .NET Core namespaces.</p>

<p>This is my own work. Use at your own risk.</p>
